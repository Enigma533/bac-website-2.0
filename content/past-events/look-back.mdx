Bengaluru Anime Club (BAC) hosted an exclusive fan screening of *Look Back* on October 27th at Orion Mall, in collaboration with [AniSync](https://store.anisync.com/) and [PVR](https://www.pvrcinemas.com/). Despite Look Back not being part of any franchise, over 50 animation enthusiasts turned up to pay homage to the craft. Attendees were treated to commemorative tickets and booklets courtesy of BAC/AniSync. BAC also held a raffle for a volume each of two Fujimoto manga: *Before Chainsaw Man 17-21*, and *Goodbye, Eri*.

In connection with the screening, BAC had organised a **4-koma competition**. The winner were [Ali Khan](https://www.instagram.com/coralmage) in the Fujino (comedy) category and [Balamurugan](https://www.instagram.com/artbybala213) in the Kyomoto (artistic) category. Other winners include [Rithika](https://www.instagram.com/Ritity_egaku) and **medha/ᐠ.ꞈ.ᐟ\\** in Fujino, and [Ganba Rosé](https://www.instagram.com/ganba_rose) and [Nana](https://www.instagram.com/nana_egaki) in Kyomoto.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to **AniSync**, **PVR Cinemas**, and **every single fan** who joined us in celebrating this beloved anime along with the volunteers who made this possible. Your passion and energy made the event unforgettable, and we can’t wait to bring you more exciting anime screenings and events in the near future. Stay tuned!
