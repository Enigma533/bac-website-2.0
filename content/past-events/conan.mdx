Following the screening of *Detective Conan vs. Kid the Phantom Thief*, the Bengaluru Anime Club (BAC), in collaboration with AniSync and PVR, hosted an exclusive fan screening of **Detective Conan: Million Dollar Pentagram** on October 6th at Orion Mall, Dr Rajkumar Road, Rajajinagara. The event was a vibrant gathering of over 40 Conan enthusiasts, where attendees were treated to custom-designed posters, printed tickets, and collectible stickers courtesy of AniSync.

The excitement did not end with the movie! Fans also put their Detective Conan knowledge to the test in a thrilling **quiz competition**. A special congratulations to our quiz champions - [Shruti](https://www.instagram.com/introverted_blue_turtle), [Abhay](https://www.instagram.com/abhay_kumar4) and [Harshita](https://www.instagram.com/shawol_ridsi), who outsmarted the rest with their sharp detective skills.
