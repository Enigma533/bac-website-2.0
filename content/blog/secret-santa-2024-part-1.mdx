      Dear **Medha** UwU,

      I've been thinking about how cute you are, and your preferences and what I got to know of you till date. I've found the perfect fit: The Masterful Cat is Depressed again. The title is very misleading - this is a wholesome and comedy anime. Shojoesque, in your words. The mc is a panicky girl who is always late to work and yet has a very organised room. She has proper home cooked meals even though she spends the evening getting drunk and passing out in bed! How is this possible? Her CAT - takes care of the house. It's most of the time funny and does have a few heart touching moments as well. I think the mc is very very relatable.

      PS - I went through your whole MAL - I was so happy. You watched so many things that reminded me of my childhood. And this anime was not on there. Whew. 

      Platonic Hugs and kisses, \

      Hey **Swati** 🎀

      First of all, I just need to tell you how much I absolutely adore your mal. Your vibes? Immaculate. Your anime scoring? Chef’s kiss. Honestly, everything about you just seems so lovely, and I can’t get over how amazing your taste in anime is! Every anime you’ve watched has this cozy, beautiful vibe, and I’m just in love with all of it. So, I wanted to recommend something I feel perfectly matches your energy: Barakamon!

      Barakamon is such a warm, wholesome anime, and I feel like it’ll speak to your heart. The story follows Seishuu Handa, a professional calligrapher (yes, those amazing people who turn writing into art!). After a bit of a breakdown and losing his way in life, his dad decides to send him to a quiet little village in the middle of nowhere to reset. What follows is this absolutely lovely and hilarious journey as Handa navigates the quirky village life, meets the local residents (especially the kids omg, they're little monsters lol), and slowly rediscovers his passion and purpose.

      It’s one of those anime that just makes you feel good inside. It’s funny, it’s heartwarming, and it’s so full of life. The interactions between Handa and the villagers are equal parts chaotic and touching, and you can’t help but fall in love with the charm of the countryside and its people. By the end of it, you’re left with this fuzzy, happy feeling like you’ve just had the coziest hug.

      Slice of life, feel good and comedy, I honestly really think Barakamon is something you’d adore. It’ll make you laugh, maybe tear up a little, but mostly, it’ll just make you feel good. Let me know what you think when you watch it, okay? I’m so excited for you to experience it!

      Sending you lots of love and good vibes 🩷 \

      Hey **Woori**, Merry Christmas! 

      The anime I want to recommend you is Non Non Biyori. It is slice of life, comedy and is a light-hearted series. The minute I read your preferences and what you want to avoid, I remembered this anime. It's just so comforting to watch and it's not heavy or anything like that. Basically it's a story revolving around 4 girls who live in the Japanese country side. As Christmas and New Year's coming up you might want to watch something that will be comforting and gives you a fuzzy feeling. I personally love this anime and watch it whenever I'm overwhelmed or after I've watched something heavy. There are 3 seasons in total, 12 ep each. I hope you'll like the anime I've recommended and enjoy watching it 🎀✨💞

      Hey **Sakura**,

      Do you want to feel Bonita? Then this is the show for you. It has niche interest otakus, a super-fabulous diva who is everyone's fairy godperson and so much beautiful fashion!

      The story follows Tsukimi, a jellyfish otaku with severe social anxiety who lives in a share house with other otakus of varied interests. Important point, everyone in the share house is a woman and they call themselves The Sisterhood. The one holy rule of the share house is - No Men Allowed.

      But Tsukimi breaks this rule, by bringing in her jellyfish saviour, a glamorous woman who turns out to be a man named Kuranosuke. Kuranosuke cross-dresses because of his own otaku tendencies and to feel closer to his mom who will have passed away. Tsukimi, The Sisterhood and faux Sisterhood member Kuranosuke get into all sorts of hijinks going on to create some pretty amazing clothes.

      It makes you feel seen, heard, angry and happy. Pretty short but it is compact with themes of all sorts of acceptance. It is a slice of life romance comedy that will make you feel all sorts of feels. You will end up cheering on for this dysfunctional found family of weird women and a weirder man and the people they bring into their chaotic orbit. At the end of the day, it tells you it is okay to be a socially anxious otaku obsessed with jellyfish.

    </div>

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hi **Atharva**, 
      
      I would like to recommend you to watch - "My Stepmom's Daughter is my Ex" , since I have gone through your preferred genres and saw Romance and Comedy as one of them which is what this anime is about. Moreover your other preference was to recommend not the popular ones so I really hope you still haven't come across this one as I went through your MAL and didn't find it in your list.

      Now coming to why I chose this particular anime for you is because while going through your Watched list i observed "Domestic Girlfriend" there which gave me an idea that you may like watching a plot on step siblings , also I saw few other romantic anime in your list like - Kaguya Sama, Maid Sama, Higehiro ,and it seems you prefer refreshing romance stories and hence I believe this one may catch your interest.
      So the summary on the anime is - A boy and a girl started dating in middle school and were happy at first but due to a trivial misunderstanding they broke up when they graduated. However, Mizuto Irido and Yume Ayai meet again in a surprising way as Step Siblings.
      So, out of consideration for their parents, this former couple comes up with a "sibling rule" game , which is: "Whoever starts seeing the other as potentially attractive loses."

      But because of the moments they shared as a couple earlier, they find it difficult to cope up with this sibling show at some unavoidable circumstances like staying alone at home or running into each other after bath, so how they react in these situations is worth a watch.
      I really wish that would try to watch it and like this one.

      **Sakura**

      hi **Astrop**, hows it going, hows life, anyways u mentioned isekai, fantasy and romcom in ur liked genres, u came to the right person... the only problem was u also mentioned harem in ur disliked genre, so yeaaaaa.... mildly cooked (theres so many good isekai harem out thereee) anyways...

      for now, my main recommendation to u is kenja no mago, (forgot the english name) but its not a great anime, ofc its an isekai so like what are u expecting... but its fun, it tries to blend in casting magic with real world science, its like midly brain dead but i love it, it used to be one of my favorite guilty pleasures, unironically it was also i think joey (the anime man)'s best bad anime of the year once back when it released, its a good anime, hits all the slice of life, rom com, isekai, fantasy boxes, it isnt harem, and it isnt slow paced, its just midly relaxed, its fun... GIVE IT A SHOT

      now on to my second recommendation, 
      DEMON LORD 2099 FUCKINNN GOATED ASS ANIME, this would have been like my main recommendation, but this is still airing, im caught up but yes dunno where it might go so wouldnt back it up completely, BUTTT FUCKINNN HELL W ASS ANIMEE, like this anime popped up to me like a leprechaun on viagra, dope as fuck, i dont wanna dive too deep into it, but yes, it's shallow at times and when it goes deep, it goes deep HARRDDD.... like just the setting of this anime, modern day japan collided with a random ass fantasy world, so now u have akihabara but at the ssame time its all magical, its like cyberpunk, but if they had magic
      best anime of this season for me, but then again other than this im only watching arifureta s3...

      thanks you for coming to my ted talk, if u couldnt read all of it, i'd recommend u copy paste this into chat gpt and ask it to tldr... cuz i can be sir yap a lot if i wanna be..

      anyways wish you a merry christmas, and a happy new year peace out UwU \

      Helloo **KuroNeko717**, \
      First of all without directly getting into the recommendation. I wanna greet you , I am not sure whether we will cross our path or not but I am hoping you must be doing really good even if not then gambare ,you can do it. Try to enjoy your life - basically flavours of youth 😂. I am literally writing this at 12.20 AM, I have classes tomorrow and lot of work pending but I don't feel like studying so decided to do this .

      So the anime which I wanna suggest you is "Fukka" , okay before getting deep into this , let me connect my earphone and put the song from this anime ( which is really really great , so don't forget to check them out ... infact I would say put the song on while reading this- the one am listening right now is "Climber high" and also later check the video song of this as well , I infact love the singer she looks so cool and badass)  so I watched this anime during covid time and it's become one of my favorite , as it's one of those anime with only 12 episodes.

      Am really a sucker of such anime which got less episodes but really good plot.  So if in brief I have to concise it  follows the story of Yuu Haruna, a high school student who moves to Tokyo and meets a mysterious girl named Fuuka Akitsuki. Drawn together by their shared love for music, they form a band and navigate the challenges of friendship, love, and the pursuit of their dreams. But a twist , there is more to that, a love triangle. I don't know but many people hate love triangle including me , because of its cheesey nature but despite that I don't know why I enjoyed this , every bit of it . The animation , visuals , character development and the music is the soul of this anime.

      I hope you enjoy this anime ,so give this a check for sure 
      Also as winter is here so I wanna suggest you one more song it's one of my favourite Japanese song -

      Hello **AxissPrime**,

      I would like to recommend “Wagnaria!!” which is a slice of life & comedy anime that should be right up your alley. I recall when I was watching this anime, I had a blast with the story, and funny scenes, while it also had a bit of suspense with the romantic relationships amongst its characters.
      This anime has 3 seasons with a total of (13+13+13+1) Episodes, I hope you would give this a chance and enjoy this as much as I did.
      I really wished I could suggest you some more animes, but as per the rules I had to submit only one.

      I too love watching anime with the following genres you specified (Military, Historical, Mecha, Mythological, Organised Crime, Action, Steampunk, Suspense, Sci-fi, Slice of Life)
      I hope we could connect and become friends and talk more about anime.

      Merry Christmas & Happy New Year in Advance ☆*: .｡. o(≧▽≦)o .｡.:*☆ \

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hello, **Sanket** san! Merry Christmas and a happy new year! My recommendation for you is "86", or Eighty Six(not the car, don't worry!). I thought it would be fitting, considering you asked for a military anime and you seem to have watched Lycoris Recoil(absolutely similar tastes we have, by the way).

      Eighty six is basically child soldiers in mechs fighting against automatons.(Hey, sounds familiar!). It's got tons of neat action scenes that I think you'll like, and the characters are really well written, like AOT is. It's also got lots of pretty realistic depictions of trauma though, so if that's an issue, please be cautious.

      Shin Nouzen, or the Undertaker, is the main character, and weirdly reminds me of Eren, with his longing for freedom, although in a very different way(watch the series to find out more).

      I tried to not make this look generic, I'm sorry, and once again, happy padoru and new year! \

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Merīkurisumasu, **Nabz**! This here is your Secret Santa anime recommendation.

      Chihayafuru is an anime that beautifully blends sports and romance at its core. The story follows Chihaya Ayase, a high school girl admired for her beauty but not the most conversational. Beneath her quiet demeanor lies a fiery passion for Karuta—a traditional Japanese card game where you have to grab the card with the matching poem faster than anyone else.

      Her love for Karuta started back in elementary school when she met Arata, a prodigy at the game and her first big inspiration. Together with him and her friend Taichi, she experiences the excitement and beauty of Karuta. But life takes a turn when Arata has to move away due to family reasons. Years later, in her final year of high school, Chihaya reignites her passion for Karuta during a school competition, setting off a journey filled with intense matches, emotional bonds, and the pursuit of her dreams.

      Now, this is the generic description—but here’s why you in particular will love this anime:
      The first time they play serious Karuta instantly reminded me of Hinata’s instinctive spike in the first episode of Haikyuu!! (which, by the way, if you haven’t seen yet, go watch it—it’s a masterpiece of sports anime). That same mix of adrenaline and raw talent hits you hard.

      On top of that, the way the characters interact—funny, light-hearted moments that seamlessly switch to nail-biting seriousness—has its own unique charm. And let’s not forget the love triangle between Chihaya, Arata, and Taichi. It’ll leave you torn between rooting for Team Arata or Team Taichi. It’s weirdly fun to keep switching sides as the story unfolds.

      If you love sports anime with heart, deep friendships, and a touch of romance, Chihayafuru is a perfect pick for you. Plus, the Karuta matches hit harder than you’d expect.

      Let me know whose team you end up on—Team Arata or Team Taichi! 👀

      Hello **Sakaido**,

      Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year. I've got a fantastic anime recommendation for you, based on the themes that you wished Santa NabZ would gift you with. and it is *Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu*. This anime is an absolute gem that combines themes of Historical, drama, and performing Arts.

      I actually somewhat dislike theater as a medium, but this anime all about a Japanese oral tradition comedic theater performance medium, and its endurance over time totally entranced me. It takes place over the course of the 20th century and follows a small set of performers who keep rakugo alive and thriving through drastic Japanese era changes. The story begins with a man called Yotaro, who is released from prison on good behavior in the 60s/70s, determined to become a rakugo performer after he witnesses the reigning rakugo master perform at his prison. He begs to be the master's apprentice, and the first cour of the anime focuses on that master's own apprenticeship and growth as an artist, largely around the WW2 era. 

      I would say it's primarily a drama, but it builds in lots of other elements since it is a show all about storytelling, and the performers tell many different kinds of stories. Another core element of the show is family - arguably the main character, Bon, is abandoned by his family because he is unable to perform geisha dances due to his ruined leg. So a lot of the story focuses on the foster family that nurtures him and his own efforts to pay it forward, sort of, once he is an adult. This plot line continues basically through the present day, where Yotaro takes over as protagonist (and explores many similar themes from a new perspective). I just want to flag that I cried during 8 of the second cour's 12 episodes and was shocked by how well the story builds in emotional climaxes. I don't want to say a whole lot because the best parts are spoilers, but the series really offers a lot to many different kinds of viewers, IMO. Much like the rakugo performers, it depicts, the show has tremendous range and quietly flexes its adaptability. I do want to ment' that the series has unexpected visual flair. A lot of the direction is realist - at first, you'll think it's just a historical period piece. But rakugo performers regularly broach the fantastic realm.

    </div>

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      Hey **Kanad Roy**,

      It’s actually quite hard to recommend Shinsekai Yori, because I need to be cautious about how much of it I give away. The show itself is as cautious if not more so. It’s almost like the writers keep asking, “is it okay to hand out this information to the viewer right now, or can we sit on it for a few more episodes? Or perhaps, can we not show it to them at all and expect them to figure it out from all the other clues we’ve given them?” Forget ‘show, don’t tell’ — Shinsekai Yori sometimes follows a ‘don’t show, don’t tell’ approach. I’m prefacing my recommendation with all this for good reason. This is perhaps the biggest barrier to entry, with many people dropping the show early on after perceiving it to be “boring”, “confusing”, or “aimless”. I just want you to know that, even though I can’t reveal a lot of what makes Shinsekai Yori great, I want you to rest assured that no matter how little you might be enjoying the early episodes of the show, later greatness awaits.

      In the world of Shinsekai Yori, humans develop psychic powers (termed ‘Cantus’) at some point in the 21st century; the story, however, takes place over a thousand years after this fact, in Ibaraki, Japan. The power awakens in a person’s early teens, as it does for 12 year old Saki Watanabe, resident of a tiny secluded village. She transfers to a school for psychics with her other friends, where she attempts to hone her powers. Shinsekai Yori is the story of Saki’s coming of age over the next decade and a half — a tumultuous period in the life of any teen, but especially so for Saki and her friends as they learn more about their world, including things that should not have been...

      I don’t want to say too much after this point, but I think Shinsekai Yori is right up your alley. You have the ‘allegory of the cave’ setup (and the many twists and turns it brings) of Attack on Titan and 86, the supernatural powers and class conflict themes of Code Geass and Akira, the philosophical and ideological back-and-forth of Fate/Zero and Vinland Saga, and the examinations of humanity at its lowest point (Berserk, Death Note) and at its most resilient (A Silent Voice, Wolf Children). You said you wanted Supernatural, Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Suspense, Psychological, Drama, Romance...well you’re getting it all in one thrilling 25 episode package.

      Another reason why I think you should check out Shinsekai Yori is because it touches on quite a few themes that the average young Indian can relate to, chiefly among them the way adult society almost fears children and their young minds because of the change they can bring, and goes out of its way to control them and mould them into the harmless inoffensive form they want and expect. The show has a lot of commentary on this. It shows how the education system is used to suppress original thought and intellectual rebellion, how society punishes those youth who do not meet its narrow expectations, and how children are ultimately seen as “products”: “eggs” that can be thrown out and smashed for the slightest imperfection. I think the average washed up JEE/NEET grinder (like me ;_;) has more than one thought on this matter.

      It’s also a brilliantly directed show, with perhaps the greatest color design in all of anime. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful too with its choral chants and soft electronic rock.

      I end this with a warning: be prepared to sacrifice your sleep for Shinsekai Yori, even after you’ve finished it. It is the type of show that keeps you awake at night, thinking about it.

      I think you will love Serial Experiments Lain. It generally belongs to the sci-fi and psychological genres which you preferred. I generally don't recommend it to the new fans. But since we are not recommending the mainstream stuff and I don't have any way to know what type of anime you have watched before, so I decided to go with this.

      There are two standards I hold true for anime. There are anime that simply entertain for the sake of enjoyment, and there are anime that stretches the boundary of human imagination.  Serial Experiments Lain falls in the latter category and for this reason Serial Experiments Lain stands out as a true classic. Serial Experiments Lain pushes the envelope of what the perceived notion of what can be done with television as a medium.

      If I were ever to direct an existentialist anime, I would definitely turn to this series for some major inspiration. It tries to tackle the problem of existence and identity. Well, you will have to rewatch this show a few time to fully understand what it is trying to convey cause it's more on the psychological side like Eva, Paranoia Agent, etc. It may seem pretentious at first, like I also thought that at first. But give it some rewatches and you can surely like. Share me your opinions after watching it.

      Hey **wrath** 🌸

      For my Secret Santa recco, I wanted to give you something really special, and after going through your favorite genres and highly-rated anime, I felt like To Your Eternity (Fumetsu no Anata e) would be absolutely perfect for you. It’s not just an anime; it’s an experience, one that I think will really resonate on so many levels.

      The story starts with this mysterious orb sent to Earth by a higher being. At first, it’s just a rock, but it has the ability to take on the form of anything it encounters. It becomes a wolf, then eventually a human, and thus begins this incredible journey of learning what it means to be alive. Through the orb’s eyes, you see life in its rawest, purest form—the beauty, the heartbreak, the joy, and the sorrow.

      What I love most about this anime is how deeply it explores humanity. It makes you think about questions like, what does it mean to truly live? What is happiness? What is generosity? What is grief? 

      Every connection the orb forms, every experience it has, shapes its understanding of life, and you can’t help but reflect on your own. It’s one of those rare stories that stays with you, makes you see the world a little differently, and appreciate the smaller things in life.

      I really think this is one of those anime everyone should watch because it’s so profound and meaningful.

      Some drama, fantasty and adventure, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. I’d love to hear your thoughts after you watch it!

      Merry Christmas and happy watching 🩷 \

      Hi **Sumukha**, 
      
      After looking at your top anime (9s/10s), it was no brainer for me to see that you love your mystery. Not only are you a fan of Detective Conan movies, but also shows like Psycho-Pass, Baccano!, Made in Abyss, and the Monogatari series, which all caught my attention. Given that, I believe Gankutsuou would be a perfect fit for you.

      Like Baccano, it has a historical tone to it but it is actually set in future with a sci-fi setting. The early episodes take their time building up the mystery, keeping you on the edge of your seat until the full picture comes together. 

      And Gankutsuou checks out as a nice character drama, that can also be seen as a coming-of-age story. With teenagers, romance is inevitable, but it’s far from the usual tropes and is secondary to the plot (not officially categorized as romance by MAL).

      By the way, did I talk about the animation style yet?  It is visually stunning and often considered as an "arthouse anime". Hope you enjoy watching it.

      **wrath**

      Hey **Ishida May**,

      Saiki K is a comedy anime, it is one of the funniest  anime that I've watched, if you're a fan of fast and quick witted gag humour, you'll love it as well.

      The humour in this anime is from the absurdity of the situations surrounding the mc and it's very funny how he tries to get away from all the weird situations that arises from the antics of his friends and family. The mc just wants to have a normal highschool life, he is an introverted person who hates social situations (I'm introverted as well, hence I could relate a lot with the mc). Oh yeah, one more thing, the mc is a psychic and he uses his psychic powers to escape all the problems that comes his way. Anyway it's very funny ( I have rewatched it multiple times), so please do check it out.

      I would've loved to recommend a few more anime but won't be able to because of the rules :(
      Thanks for reading this huge wall of text btw.

      Hey **Asmit**, 
      
      Merry Christmas! Let me start by mentioning that my recommendation is a manga, and it’s much longer than a 26-episode anime series. Sorry about that, but I promise it’s worth the investment since you mentioned wanting a story that’s nearly flawless in plot, has sci-fi elements, and is firmly rooted in the seinen genre. 

      Honestly, this one checks all those boxes and then some. At its core, it’s a high-stakes mystery, complete with global conspiracies, intricate whodunits, and characters whose relationships and growth really resonate. The narrative spans decades, ensuring plenty of emotional payoffs along the way.

      In case you're wondering what the plot is about, it starts with a group of friends in late-1960s Japan who spend their free time imagining future threats and heroic deeds, only to find, decades later, that their childhood fantasies are coming true in deadly ways.

      I’m confident you’ll love this manga. Wishing you a wonderful Christmas! \

    </div>

    <div style = {{alignItems: 'center', justifyContent: 'center', marginBottom: '0px'}} className = "px-5">

      My recommendation to you **LazyEmperor**, respecting your guidelines would be "Grand Blue" fulfilling comedy, gag and sort of seinen genre and being under 13 episodes and also avoiding shoujo, josei, romance, Isekai, sci-fi theme/s but unfortunately lacks any hand to hand combat scene. I have already confirmed that you have seen one episode but didn't came back to it, so I have put a small encouragement review for you to let it escape from the "To Watch List" aka blackhole.

      So I will straight away start with the main selling point of the show that is the character chemistry among the wide range of cast. The characters are the life of any comedy anime. Without fun, fitting characters, a comedy anime just won't be the same. Grand Blue has a good variety of different personalities which compliment each other perfectly to create hilarious exchanges. Whether it is a dumb, over the top MC, or an "ikemen otaku", or awkward virgin friends,  men or women who couldn't care less about getting drunk and stripping in public, Grand Blue has a good variety to keep the entertainment going.

      Regardless whether you like it or not, there’s an abundance amount of humor when the guys interact with each other and it often comes off as absurd humor or rather slap stick comedy. The most prominent character chemistry is between Iori(MC) and Kouhei(ikemen otaku). They are often observant but says things that always interpretes in a wrong way, getting into trouble for their actions that disregards common sense. The two also gets into many bickering hilarious moments. The series have no bounds for shimoneta jokes. And let’s not forget about the drinking(works as a humor catalyst) that always leads to hilarious consequences, the guys behave like drunks while stripping, causing questionable scenes and what not.

      The show is set in a College life as is a bit different from generic high school trope in anime. To me it’s was like venturing into a society where some people live by the rules while others makes them, and this is typically showcased in Grand Blue that explores a carefree life, while mixing in adult humor, diving elements(as it revolves around a diving club) and drinking. Even features an Evangelion easter egg. It’s one of those shows that is hard to stop laughing your ass off once you realized what you’re in for. 

      I highly anticipate to hear back your takes if you manage to give it a shot. \

      Hi there **HooArt**,

      Thank you for being a good sport and taking part in the Online Secret Santa and being a part of the festivities here @BAC.
      Without further ado, let's get to the anime rec i feel would fit right into your anime library based on your MAL watchlist (great selection of anime you got there btw).

      The anime I chose for you goes by the name Grimgar of Fantasy and Ash.
      This show has an isekai setting with amazing visuals and has a sense of realism to it.
      There are no OP protagonists in this world chief. Everyone's gotta fend for themselves with whatever little power they have awoken with.
      There is distrust, backstabbing, pain, separation, heartbreak all across this show. This is what makes it unexpected and different from the rest of the medium. 
      The character interactions and their development as you progress through the episodes will leave you wanting for more.

      This isn't a fast, action packed fast-food show. It's slow and allows for characters to grow into their roles.
      Did i mention the art style is pretty unique as well?
      Do give it a try and let me know whether this is to your liking or not.
      I hope we get to continue our correspondence post the event as well. 

      This is **Buff Potato** signing out. Peace!

      Hello **Ash**, 
      
      I highly recommend "Shinsekai Yori" (From the New World) for its thought-provoking and psychologically complex narrative. Since I didn't get any information about your watched anime on MAL ..I assume this show is going to a must watch or a rewatch if u already watched it. With its unique blend of science fiction, mystery, and philosophical introspection, the show challenges viewers to question their assumptions about humanity and society and confuse your mind on what's right and what's wrong. The series' atmospheric tension, coupled with its well-developed characters, makes for a gripping and unforgettable viewing experience. If you're looking fot a emotionally resonative ,thrilling, mind bending Psychedelic experience, "Shinsekai Yori" is my choice. Merry Christmas!.

      Hello **Vinsmoke Vegeta**, 
      
      I read that you are interested in horror and psychological thrillers so I made these 3 recommendations and I hope you like one of them. 

      I am recommending Ajin because it is a dark and interesting story that explores the evil side of humans. The story can keep the consistence, showing the main message from beginning until the end and where every episode expands more on the story, while focusing on the most important elements.It’s a good horror story, that keep us attracted to the story from beginning.

      Serial Experiments Lain followed me through many different points of my mind, in many ways. The anime really explores the way the digital world and the internet ""connect"" people, leaving them lonelier in the process. It is slow paced but I hope you enjoy the surreal and existential journey. 

      Terror of resonance is a 11 episodes/pretty bingeable anime  It is beautiful, have a compelling music, decent story and characters to make it worth a watch. 

      Bonus reccs: monster, psycho pass, death parade, Moriarty the Patriot and welcome to the NHK. 

      Merry Christmas and I hope you like your gift  ฅ⁠^⁠•⁠ﻌ⁠•⁠^⁠ฅ \

      Hi **Buff Potato**,

      I think you might really enjoy this series if you are looking for a good slice of life. People might mistake it at as a generic school romcom show by seeing the poster but it is so much more than that. I won't bore you with the summary as it's readily available on many websites. I'll just say that every character interaction and their behaviour in the anime is very humane and genuine. There's also a good amount of comedy in the show (not the slapstick kind, it's very natural comedy which might happen in everyday life). 

      There is no crazy premise as is expected from a SOL. There are no crazy situations like death or world ending disaster nor a hint of any fantasy element. What makes this show special is the effort characters put in to connect with each other. People don't instantly become friends but their relationships develop based on their experiences and interactions. The cast and seiyuus for them are perfect. They all have their own biases towards other students. They act like real high school kids.

      The animation in the show is fluid and really well done. Unlike many other SOL anime there is no corner cutting in the animation department, everything looks really beautiful. Also the music in the show including the OP, ED and the OSTs are really good.

      I am actually out of station right now so I don't really have much time to list all the reasons why I love this anime so much. Only thing I can say is overall this show is super wholesome and definitely one of the best SOLs to have come out in recent years. And based on your anime list and similarity in our anime tastes I think you will also love this show.

      Hi **HITPOOL**,

      First of all, thank you for taking part in the Online Secret Santa and being a part of the festivities at BAC [^_^]

      After going through your preferred genres and your MAL profile, I feel "Drifters" would be a show right up your alley. It's a (pardon my French) Balls to the walls action packed show with a bunch of historically significant figures taking part in a war in the other world (Isekai/Fantasy?).

      The show has some overall decent character interaction and they bounce-off well across one another. It's got humor and seriousness mixed in which goes really well surprisingly.
      You'll always be kept at the edge of your seat anticipating what happens next after every episode.
      It's got funky art-style which you might find refreshing.

      This show does not have any life lessons or will not have you ponder deep into the night wondering what you are doing in life. It is a show which promises on what it delivers (Or is it the other way around?).

      Ayt that's about it from my end. Peace! \
      **Buff Potato**

      PS: In case you like this kinda show, I would suggest you consider reading Majo Taisen (Its AWESOME)

      PPS: Looking forward to continuing our correspondence beyond this event!
