_Hoshi Mamoru Inu (Stargazing Dog)_ and its sequel, _Zoku Hoshi Mamoru Inu (Star Protector Dog)_, by Takashi Murakami, are deeply emotional single volume manga that explore the bond between humans and their dogs. The first volume tells the story of Happy, a loyal dog, and his owner, a man who faces personal and financial struggles, as they journey together in search of solace. The sequel expands the narrative, introducing new characters whose paths intersect with Happy’s legacy.

Both of these manga are short but impactful reads that resonate deeply, especially with pet lovers. They explore themes like love, loss, hardships of human lives, and  beautifully describe the unconditional love a pet offers to its owner, making them must-reads for those who appreciate heavy, emotional, heart-wrenching, bittersweet stories.

P.S. It was adapted into a live-action film with the same title in 2011!

# **Message to Adolf**

_Message to Adolf_, or simply _Adolf_, is a compelling historical thriller manga written and illustrated by the Godfather of Manga, Osamu Tezuka. Set in the backdrop of World War II, it follows three men named Adolf — a Jewish boy in Japan, a half-Japanese half-German boy, and Adolf Hitler himself. The story follows a Japanese journalist - Sohei Toge - who uncovers a startling secret that connects the three Adolfs. This secret puts Toge on a dangerous journey, crossing paths with spies, secret police and other ruthless officials who will stop at nothing to keep it hidden. The narrative weaves historical events with the fictional lives of its characters, skillfully blending thriller with political drama and suspense. Within its compact size of only four volumes it explores themes like the psychological impact of war, friendship and betrayal, ideological conflicts and horrors of fascism, all while maintaining a gripping narrative pace and emotional depth. This mature work showcases Tezuka’s range and is regarded as one of his most ambitious and thought-provoking manga.

**Note:** This manga contains sensitive images, including gore and violence. Recommended for ages 16 and above.
