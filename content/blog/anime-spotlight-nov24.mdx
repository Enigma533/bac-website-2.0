For the inaugural edition of _Anime Spotlight_, we are excited to showcase an anime that delves into the intricate and often challenging process of bringing an animated series to life. This week, we shine a light on **_Shirobako_**, a captivating series by _P.A. Works Studio_, which provides an in-depth look at the creative journey and trials faced by the dedicated individuals behind the scenes in the anime industry.

Shirobako is a story of five best friends who discover their passion for anime, and decide to make a career in the anime industry. Underneath the deceptively simple appearance of these 5 girls trying to make their dreams come true, it's an insider view of the world of anime production with all its challenges. It doesn't glorify or portray animators as born-geniuses, but as people with realistic talents and passion for their jobs. The characters' struggles and triumphs in the industry are super relatable, whether you're an anime fan or just about any other corporate employee. 

What really sets Shirobako apart is how it dives deep into the small details of anime production. From tight deadlines to unexpected blockers, turn-of-events and sheer chaos (which might be common in the anime industry), it sheds light on how anime is actually made. The characters are fleshed out really well, showcasing real personal and professional growth in the span of just 24 episodes. It also shows the harsh reality of the industry, how some people can get their foot in the industry early on, while others can struggle to find meaningful opportunities. There are also tons of easter eggs and references to actual well-known figures in the anime industry. In a nutshell, Shirobako is a very enjoyable anime to watch, and at the same time it teaches you a lot about life, careers, and of course anime. \
